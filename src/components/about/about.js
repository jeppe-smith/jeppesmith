        I'm 28 living alone in Odense, Denmark where I have lived for going on
        seven years now. My ineterests are crossfit, heavy metal, and making
        things on my computer.

        Code quality, readability, and ease of use by the end user are what
        drives me and the work I do. When I'm happy about the way I solved a
        problem and I get positive feedback from people using it it's just the
        best.
